# Real-Time Face Recognition with Laptop Webcam

This project implements a real-time face recognition system using your laptop's webcam.  
It detects and recognizes faces live from the video stream using `OpenCV` and `face_recognition`.

## Features
- Live video capture from webcam
- Real-time face detection
- Face recognition against known faces
- Name label display on detected faces
- Easy to add new faces for recognition

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- face_recognition (based on dlib)
- NumPy
